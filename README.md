A program for raspberry pi that allows you to use it as a WiFi adapter for communication with the Sky Watcher Virtuoso telescope. For example, you can use it to communicate the telescope with the INDI server. When writing the program I was inspired by this project ... https://github.com/vlaate/SkyWatcherWiFi
For proper operation you need to disconnect the bluetooth module which is by default taking control over the serial0 RPi port. Instructions can be found on the internet. The program also allows you to print a communication pipe on the console after running it with any parameter. Connecting the telescope to RPi as in the project I used. 

I hope it will be useful. Good luck.
